- 📜 I was probably on the Internet 🌐 way before you. 😉

- 🔗 My personal site is <a rel="me" href="https://cleverhack.com" target="_blank">cleverhack dot com</a>. Cleverhack is where I self-host a few web pages, run my own mailserver, and where I previously self-hosted blogs on various platforms (Movable Type, WordPress).
